And now, thanks to Airbnb, we are sharing the place with the world. There are three buildings: the house, the studio/apartment building, the garage where one long term visitor is still living (11 years and counting). There are often interesting people hanging around our place and we'd be keen for you to be part of all that if it suits you.\r\nI work in the city - office job. My wife is far more interesting. She's an artist and does some stuff in the downstairs studio as well as teaching art and design at a university. (I might have to make up some stuff about myself.)",

It's kinda a given - to be on this site - and profess a love for travelling, but it's true! \r\n\r\nStepping off a plane onto new ground. Seeing new faces, absorbing smells and sounds of different cultures. The unease of exploring unfamiliar territories. Observing similarities & differences of communities across the world. And the taste sensations of food from local kitchens. All these inspire my constant need for seeing new parts of the world, whenever I can. \r\n\r\nAnd while I'm in between travel, I enjoy exploring my current home city of Sydney - the culture, night life, arts & music scene, beaches and bush. I thought, since I currently have a spare room, why not open my home to fellow travellers?  By making it available on Airbnb, I can continue to meet new people and experience different cultures via the people travelling through Sydney - best of both worlds indeed. \r\n\r\nAs my guest, you will be welcome to treat my place as your home away from home, a safe & comfy place to retreat to while you're in Sydney. If you like, I would also be delighted to share little hidden secrets of Sydney that I'm continuing to discover - cool little bars, best local gelato, secret gardens, little known best view points of Sydney skyline and the Harbour Bridge - from around the neighbourhood!",

All linen, towels, - everything you would expect in a hotel but much, much more space at a quarter of the price.\r\n\r\nYou are very welcome to use the entire apartment, the kitchen, laundry, lounge... everywhere!\r\n\r\nWe work during the day and sometimes go out at night but I am sure our paths will cross. We are quiet and very respectful of your space.\r\n\r\nThe location is perfect for the travelers or business men wanting quick and easy access to everything. \r\n\r\nWe are a very short walk to supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and a similarly short walk to all that Surry Hills (famous for its shopping, restaurants, bars and pubs), CBD, Circular Quay (Sydney Opera) and then Darling Harbour have to offer.\r\n\r\nBuses to the beach are a block away, light rail is at 2 minute which will take you out of the city. You have several parks around. Its a beautiful neighborhood.",

Close to Coogee Beach and city. Many tourists have heard about Bondi and this is close to where we live but we  live near the best beach in Sydney -Coogee beach. But we are even closer to one of the most special places in Sydney - Gordon's Bay, nestled 5 minutes between Coogee beach and Clovelly beach. It is a little piece of paradise which we are lucky enough to get to view every day. We have travelled often and have stayed in other people's houses and apartments, so we know and appreciate the other side of staying in a great location and home. But one of the best places to live in this world has to be Coogee, Sydney and I consider myself extremely lucky  and am sure our guests will feel that also. I love the fact that when people first walk into our home they are astounded by the beauty of our view. It has the wow factor! The ph",

    "neighborhood_overview": "I love the inner city buzz with everyone working in the city during the week & the relaxed serenity on the faces of the happy weekend city day trippers. If you don't mind a little bit of street noise on a Friday/Saturday night, it's very entertaining sitting out on the veranda with a glass of wine watching the young nightclubbers stumbling up & down King Street on their way to the next bar or just trying to stay upright while they're hailing an elusive cab to get home before they pass out on the pavement.",
    "notes": "Across the road is a mini supermarket open till late. Next door to that is a great Japanese restaurant. Below in our building is a great little vegetarian Thai restaurant. Around the corner in Sussex St is a 24hr supermarket & 2 blocks up the road on the corner of George St & King St is the Sydney Apple Store, Louis Vuitton Store & a large \"Coles Supermarket\" which is open until midnight on weeknights & 10pm on weekends. We are surrounded by plenty of nightclubs & great nightlife venues so enjoy the location. We are in the centre of the City and everything Sydney City has to offer is within walking distance. You will save a lot of money from not having to catch Buses, trains & taxis to Sydney's famous tourist attractions.",
    "transit": "You can walk to everything so you shouldn't have to rely on public transport other than travelling from the airport which is approximately a 20-25 minute taxi ride or via a short train trip to Wynyard station and a 5 minute walk to the building.  Martin Place & Town Hall train stations are also close by, each about a 6-7 minute walk. You can catch ferries from the King St Wharf to most harbour locations with a 1-2 minute walk to the end of my street. Taxi's are readily available directly outside the building & bus services are readily available from designated stops throughout the city. Walk to Barangaroo, Harbour Bridge, Opera House, Star Casino, Hyde Park, Botanical Gardens, China Town, Centre Point Tower & Darling Harbour.",
    "access": "Access is permitted to the entire apartment, except the main bedroom (unless it has been specifically included in your stay). The veranda, rooftop pool & BBQ areas are also accessible.",
    "interaction": "I only occasionally sleep at the apartment when one of the rooms are free if I'm there working until late. I will try to give you the maximum privacy during your stay although I'll still be around if required making everything perfect for you. I work several days a week at the building as the building manager & maintenance provider which is why I occasionally stay. Other than that I might be around somewhere in the building so I'm easily accessible &  contactable to promptly attend to any requirement you have to ensure your stay is perfect. My goal is for you to feel like you are staying in your own luxury City apartment. I will personally check you in on arrival & ensure you are settled in with all the essentials you need before I leave. You will be able to contact me at all times. You might occasionally see myself or my other guests who will happily assist you with any requests you may have.  Note: This is a 2 bedroom apartment. The other room is also listed.

I know Sydney like the back of my hand and I'm eager to share my local knowledge of the beautiful places & secret gems Sydney has to offer. I work at the building as the building maintenance manager & I'm around at least half of the time to easily assist you in any way I can. I'm also easily contactable at all other times and I'll ensure I make your stay awesome & memorable.\r\nAs a host, I'm always trying to improve and better myself. Every interaction with every guest adds to my experiences as a host & improves my ability to understand and service all of your needs. I love sharing information, life experiences, skills & knowledge and in turn I love to learn from others, hearing new ideas and trying new things. I'm a genuine person, I'm accepting of everyone's unique qualities and differences without any pre-judgement or criticism no matter what it is. I love meeting new people & spending time with family & friends. I enjoy all sports, running on the beach, Surfing, listing to music, going to concerts and movies, travelling and everything else life has to offer. \r\nI once played competitive sports and with a love for the outdoors I chose to study construction rather than a career that would confine me to an office chair. I also hold an associate diploma in applied science and have traveled extensively throughout Europe, North America & parts of South East Asia. Unfortunately, time & money constraints have prevented more recent travel, although I look forward to travelling more in the near future.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "I love the inner city buzz with everyone working in the city during the week & the relaxed serenity on the faces of the happy weekend city day trippers. If you don't mind a little bit of street noise on a Friday/Saturday night, it's very entertaining sitting out on the veranda with a glass of wine watching the young nightclubbers stumbling up & down King Street on their way to the next bar or just trying to stay upright while they're hailing an elusive cab to get home before they pass out on the pavement.",
    "notes": "Across the road is a mini supermarket open till late. Next door to that is a great Japanese restaurant. Below in our building is a great little vegetarian Thai restaurant. Around the corner in Sussex St is a 24hr supermarket & 2 blocks up the road on the corner of George St & King St is the Sydney Apple Store, Louis Vuitton Store & a large \"Coles Supermarket\" which is open until midnight on weeknights & 10pm on weekends. We are surrounded by plenty of nightclubs & great nightlife venues so enjoy the location. We are in the centre of the City and everything Sydney City has to offer is within walking distance. You will save a lot of money from not having to catch Buses, trains & taxis to Sydney's famous tourist attractions.",
    "transit": "You can walk to everything so you shouldn't have to rely on public transport other than travelling from the airport which is approximately a 20-25 minute taxi ride or via a short train trip to Wynyard station and a 5 minute walk to the building.  Martin Place & Town Hall train stations are also close by, each about a 6-7 minute walk. You can catch ferries from the King St Wharf to most harbour locations with a 1-2 minute walk to the end of my street. Taxi's are readily available directly outside the building & bus services are readily available from designated stops throughout the city. Walk to Barangaroo, Harbour Bridge, Opera House, Star Casino, Hyde Park, Botanical Gardens, China Town, Centre Point Tower & Darling Harbour.",
    "access": "Access is permitted to the entire apartment, except the second bedroom (unless it has been specifically included in your stay). The veranda, rooftop pool & BBQ areas are also accessible.",
    "interaction": "I only occasionally sleep at the apartment when I have a booking as I try to keep it to a minimum if possible, to give you maximum privacy during your stay. I work several days a week at the building as the building manager & maintenance provider which is when I occasionally stay. Other than that I might be around somewhere in the building making me easily accessible &  contactable & will promptly attend to any requirement you have to ensure you have the perfect stay. My goal is for you to feel like you are staying in your own luxury City apartment. I will personally check you in on arrival & ensure you are settled in with all the essentials you need before I leave. You will be able to contact me at all times. You might occasionally see myself or a roommate who will happily assist you with any requests you may have. (Note: I currently don't have a roommate in the second room. It is not my main residence so I only stay there 1-2 nights a week although this can change at any time).",
    "house_rules": "Arrival: please verify expected arrival time a minimum 48hrs prior to your arrival to ensure you are not kept waiting when you arrive for your booking. I do not live at the building & I arrive in advance of meeting you for check-in to prepare the apartment for you so at times you may have to wait for the preparation to be 100% complete.  Cleaning: The apartment is self-serviced, cleaning equipment is provided. A one off 'departure clean' fee is charged at the time of making the booking. Additional cleaning can be arranged by request at a small additional cost. Fresh linen, bedsheets & towels etc are provided for self service. If possible, and time permits, please wash & dry your used, linen, towels, sheets etc & return them to the linen shelf. Sufficient washing powder is provided to allow for linen self washing. Rubbish can be emptied into the rubbish chute accessible from the lift lobby directly outside the apartment door. Enjoy your stay. Respect the apartment, myself & any roommate",

I know Sydney like the back of my hand and I'm eager to share my local knowledge of the beautiful places & secret gems Sydney has to offer. I work at the building as the building maintenance manager & I'm around at least half of the time to easily assist you in any way I can. I'm also easily contactable at all other times and I'll ensure I make your stay awesome & memorable.\r\nAs a host, I'm always trying to improve and better myself. Every interaction with every guest adds to my experiences as a host & improves my ability to understand and service all of your needs. I love sharing information, life experiences, skills & knowledge and in turn I love to learn from others, hearing new ideas and trying new things. I'm a genuine person, I'm accepting of everyone's unique qualities and differences without any pre-judgement or criticism no matter what it is. I love meeting new people & spending time with family & friends. I enjoy all sports, running on the beach, Surfing, listing to music, going to concerts and movies, travelling and everything else life has to offer. \r\nI once played competitive sports and with a love for the outdoors I chose to study construction rather than a career that would confine me to an office chair. I also hold an associate diploma in applied science and have traveled extensively throughout Europe, North America & parts of South East Asia. Unfortunately, time & money constraints have prevented more recent travel, although I look forward to travelling more in the near future.",

There\u2019s really nowhere in the world quite like Darling Harbour. From first light to starry nights, there\u2019s always something going on here. Coffee machines froth, water laps, children play, friends chat, steaks sear, glasses clink, bass thumps and fireworks crackle. Infectious sounds travel on harbour breezes as text messages and online updates share snapshots of good times. There are tons of things to do in the city itself which are mostly a quick stroll away. I've included most of my favorite places and more in my extensive \"Local Recommendations Guidebook\" on this listings page, so please feel free to check em' out for awesome things to do and eat in the CBD area.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Erskineville has a history that is connected to the railways, and also manufacturing (including boots and bolts). More recently the area has been undergoing transformation, and we now have a vibrant and diverse neighbourhood. We have lived here for 20 years and our children have grown up here and attend local schools. We have always felt there is a sense of community. The local village strip is a short stroll, with traditional pubs, small bars, cafes, restaurants, a deli, bakery, chemist, newsagency, post office, vet, florist, petrol station, and a more recent small supermarket.

With festivals and shows popping up all over the city including Hyde Park and the Rocks and with weekend markets just a short walk into Surry Hills and Paddington, this place is perfected located for discovering Sydney. Mrs Maquiarie's Chair is a lovely 5km round trip (40min walk) and the Sydney Opera House is only a 30min walk through the city. Amazing cafes are just across the road in Surry Hills with 5-10min walks to gems like Paramount Coffee Project, Reuben Hills and Single Origin Coffee Roasters. My personal recommendation is Suzie Q Coffee which is about a 15min walk into Surry Hills. The nightlife is buzzing this side of town with hidden bars and amazing restaurants in Surry Hills, cheap eats down George St and China Town and clubs in the city. The closest supermarket is the IGA on Oxford St or Coles in World Square, both about 5min",

Also 5 minutes walk to Pitt St mall for all your shopping needs. You'll have heaps of food options to choose from. It depends on your tastes but I can recommend my personal favourites : Chat Thai 20 Campbell St. Haymarket - best Thai food Cargo Bar - Cheapest but excellent australian steak and chips deal for only 10 Din Tai Fung World Square - fantastic dumplings. Also try Uncle Mings on York Street. Macchiato Wood Fire Pizza corner liverpool and Pitt Street for Italian food. Also try  Vapiano on York Street.",

I love to travel and get a feel of the places I visit, and the best way is to visit with the locals. I love Bali & would love to retire there, somewhere in the north around Amed, Candidasa or Singaraja which are my favourite places.I live on the leafy North Shore of Sydney which are considered to be the best suburbs in Sydney. Quiet with many parks but great transport with a train line only a few stops from Sydney CBD. Chatswood is only 2 stops away and is the North Shores largest shopping centre.",

Leafy, green, peaceful and safe, Kirribilli is quiet but active with the sounds of Australian life carrying across the water.  \u2004 In November the jacarandas which line the streets pop with lilac-coloured flowers. In summer, fireworks regularly burst over the harbour\u2014my backyard. The place is so nice, the Prime Minister of Australia lives a few doors away. Fair dinkum. \u2004 Kirribilli is eminently walkable, but it is hilly and steps are common. The village is uphill of me but the hill is gradual. As I live on the water, there are no hills at all between me and the ferry wharf. \u2004 Amenities here are excellent\u2014transport, cafes, groceries, laundry, cashpoint/ATM and post office are all within a 15-minute walk.",
    "notes": "\u2022 CHECK-IN & CHECK-OUT TIMES \u2004 I'm quite flexible with times, but if I have back-to-back bookings I will need to insist on a 2pm check-in and a 12 noon check-out to give me time between guests to clean your room. Nevertheless, I realise we travellers are often at the whim of the airlines, so I'm not a tyrant about it. We can always work something out. \u2004 \u2022 N\u2009O\u2009I\u2009S\u2009E \u2004 My space caters to quiet singles or couples. I am a quiet person who likes a peaceful home, and when I am writing I need it. Please be respectfully quiet for my neighbours, too; inside the building the large atrium echoes, and outside sound travels easily on my quiet street (as passing drunks sometimes demonstrate in summer). Please keep your voice down if you are on the balcony at night. \u2004 On balance I live in a quiet area, especially given my close proximity to the city. On summer weekends, passing party boats on the water can be a little annoying with their music, and it isn't unusual for there to be a house party in ea",
    "transit": "The local train station and two ferry wharves are all within 15 minutes walk and will get you from your room to the city centre (Circular Quay or Central Station) within half an hour. You can even walk it across the Harbour Bridge in 40 minutes. \u2004 Public transit is excellent, but parking is not. There is on-street parking only, and when events are on it can be competitive. I can supply a guest permit for exemption from normal parking time limits. \u2004 Door-to-door on a smooth journey, I am 45 minutes from the airport. You can choose to: \u2004 \u2022 go cheapest: catch the train to Central Station, change to the T1 line and travel three stops to Milsons Point. Walk here (10-15 mins). Total travel time 45 mins, cost ~17pp. Or: \u2004 \u2022 go scenic: catch the train to Circular Quay and catch a ferry across the picturesque harbour (welcome to Sydney!) to either Kirribilli wharf or Milsons Point wharf.

Coffee machines froth, water laps, children play, friends chat, steaks sear, glasses clink, bass thumps and fireworks crackle. Infectious sounds travel on harbour breezes as text messages and online updates share snapshots of good times. There are tons of things to do in the city itself which are mostly a quick stroll away.

Normally I would be more prepared. With that being said, I cleaned the entire apartment with the exception of the microwave and kitchen towel. Due to the short notice and not being able to clean immaculately, I gave the guest a hefty discount, which allowed her to stay in a private room in the heart of the city for cheaper than a mixed dorm in a hostel in the same location. I also stopped home on my lunch break to get her settled, took her to the rooftop pool and showed her around the apartment. I allowed her access to laundry detergents, cooking ingredients, toiletries and even left her a bottle of wine to enjoy - so I'm very surprised by her bad review.  The room can be loud as it's in the heart of the city. This also means that it's only steps to the harbour overlooking the Opera",

You will be near the harbour and in an entertainment area, therefore there is some noise, from traffic and people. When windows and doors are shut there is virtually no noise. However if you like to sleep with your window open there is traffic noise, we do provide ear plugs if you are from a remote area and noise sensitive. People who are city dwellers and global travellers claim there is no noise.",

If you want to lap up the sun at Bondi, you'll be a 45 min bus ride away.  Taronga Zoo is a pleasant stroll to Circular Quay and a 12 min ferry ride away.

You will be able to walk everywhere, or catch a ferry - the terminal is 2 minutes from your doorstep. I work from home on occasions, so may not always be able to chat even if I am home.  That said, it goes without saying that I'm more than happy to do my best to help out with any challenges you may face during your time in Sydney.",

There are many quirky small bars and numerous streets filled with restaurants and entertainment at your doorstep. You should also aim to keep the living room - a shared space - in the same state as you find it : that is, tidy. Feet with shoes on are not to be placed on the furniture, feet with socks absolutely permitted.  Please place glasses/cups that you are using onto drink coasters provided. If using your laptop on the dining table always use the placemat provided.",

There\u2019s really nowhere in the world quite like Darling Harbour. From first light to starry nights, there\u2019s always something going on here. Coffee machines froth, water laps, children play, friends chat, steaks sear, glasses clink, bass thumps and fireworks crackle. Infectious sounds travel on harbour breezes as text messages and online updates share snapshots of good times. There are tons of things to do in the city itself which are mostly a quick stroll away. I've included most of my favorite places and more in my extensive \"Local Recommendations Guidebook\" on this listings page, so please feel free to check em' out for awesome things to do and eat in the CBD area.",

It is just one street away from Cockle Bay in Darling Harbour near the IMax theatre and is about 15 min walk towards the Opera House/Harbour bridge. Also 5 minutes walk to Pitt St mall for all your shopping needs. You'll have heaps of food options to choose from. It depends on your tastes but I can recommend my personal favourites : Chat Thai 20 Campbell St. Haymarket - best Thai food Haymarket Hotel - Cheapest but excellent australian steak and chips deal for only 12 Din Tai Fung World Square - fantastic dumplings. Also try Uncle Mings on York Street. Macchiato Wood Fire Pizza corner liverpool and Pitt Street for Italian food. Also try  Vapiano on York Street.",
    "notes": "I have a carspace nearby I can rent out to you for 40/day. Please let me know as part of your booking if you require this so I can book the dates in. The security deposit of 400 is not required to be paid as part of the booking. Its only there if I need to claim for any damages AFTER you checkout and is only a maximum amount so can be much less. For the record I haven't made any claims to date.",

The room has a double bed and drawers and a rail for clothes. It is walking distance to everything Sydney has to offer - minutes away from all of Surry Hills cafes, boutiques, markets and art galleries and walking distance to all of Sydney's sights. It is also well connected with public transport and Sydney's main train station if you want to go further afield. Priority will go to longer term rentals.  **The House**  The house is a large, 4 bedroom terrace. It was recently renovated and features wooden floor boards on the lower levels and modern kitchen. We have a large living room (with TV, Apple TV and couch), a dining room, a large kitchen with gas cook",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Sydney is an amazing city! From my apartment I have the public transport at my doorstep. There is a large supermarket in the same block as my building. Also it is 5 min walking distance to the Queen Victoria building, which is one of the major shopping areas, and from Town Hall, which is the heart of Sydney. Also walking distance to Darling Harbour, to the Opera House, Hyde Park, the Cathedral, Westfield shopping centre and Chinatown.",
    "notes": "Number of people in the apartment: When booking the apartment you have to indicate the number of people staying in there. There will be additional charges if there are additional people than the booking. Car parking: There is no car parking in the building. In the Sydney city is really hard to find a street parking space.  Please search for paid car parking spaces to keep your car before your trip, to avoid frustrations!",
    "transit": "The apartment is located 5min (or less!) walking distance to Town Hall train station, which is the biggest train station after the Central train station. Also there are several buses going to Circular Quay and to the Eastern Beaches. There is a cafe next to the building, a Starbucks, McDonalds, and several shops on the block. Also there is a big supermarket if you decide to make your own meal at home!",
    "access": "The guest will have access to the rooftop terrace, that has a swimming pool and 360deg views to the city! Also there is a laundry room equipped with washing and drying machines, that is coin operated. It costs 3 dollars per machine per cleaning. Please note CHECK IN is after 2PM CHECK OUT is 11 AM Unfortunately I can't give you an early check as there are guests in the morning and the cleaner cleans the apartment from 11am until 2pm. If you need an early check in I would recommend to book the day before, or there is a luggage storage at Central Train Station ( 2 stations from the airport!)  which I recommend to leave your bags and go for a stroll in the city before your check in time! Thanks for your understanding!",
    "interaction": "I will be available via phone and email in case there is any need.  If the guest wants, I can meet them for some tips and a chat!",
    "house_rules": "I expect the guests to maintain the place as if was their own homes, clean and tidy! Before leaving: Please wash all used dishes before leaving. Take the rubbish with you. There are garbage bins on Levels 2 and 3 to drop your rubbish",

It is about 10 min walk towards the Opera House/Harbour bridge. Also 10 minutes walk to Pitt St mall for all your shopping needs. You'll have heaps of food options to choose from. It depends on your tastes but I can recommend my personal favourites : Chat Thai 20 Campbell St. Haymarket - best Thai food Haymarket Hotel - Cheapest but excellent australian steak and chips deal for only 12 Din Tai Fung World Square - fantastic dumplings. Also try Uncle Mings on York Street. Macchiato Wood Fire Pizza corner liverpool and Pitt Street for Italian food. Also try  Vapiano on York Street.",

Oxford Street delivers a lively pulse to this colourful area. Starting from the city, this iconic street moves from a commercial hub to a longer stretch of boutique and bar offerings as you progress east. Nearby Crown, Victoria and Liverpool streets are also lined with trendy boutiques, cafes, bars and restaurants. Just off Oxford Street on Burton is the teeny tiny Pocket Bar, a friendly loungeroom-like bar serving good eats and great cocktails. At old-school American joint Jazz City BBQ on Crown Street you can grab yourself a killer burger, malted milkshake, sweet potato fries or even classic american bbq. There's also the boundary-pushing Cafe Paci on Riley Street, sure to impress with their avant-garde fusion fare. It's at night that Darlinghurst really comes alive as the area's network of clubs, pubs, performance venues, small bars and gay bars fill up.",

There are handy buses running between Sydney City and along the concourse of Oxford Street to Bondi Junction, from early in the morning until late into the night.

Due to this feature, the rooms are slightly less soundproof than a solid wall, but shouldn't pose any issues, as past guests have found. However, if people are making noise downstairs in the kitchen/living room, you may hear it.",

Lot's of great restaurants around like Berta, Nomad, Longrain, Paramount, etc. There's no parking available in the building, but there is metered street parking around, or can find a parking lot to pay a daily rate (seems to be around 45-49 AUD/day in nearby lots). There are a few Go-get car rentals nearby to rent by the hour if you have a membership.",

There\u2019s really nowhere in the world quite like Darling Harbour. From first light to starry nights, there\u2019s always something going on here. Coffee machines froth, water laps, children play, friends chat, steaks sear, glasses clink, bass thumps and fireworks crackle. Infectious sounds travel on harbour breezes as text messages and online updates share snapshots of good times. There are tons of things to do in the city itself which are mostly a quick stroll away. I've included most of my favorite places and more in my extensive \"Local Recommendations Guidebook\" on this listings page, so please feel free to check em' out for awesome things to do and eat in the CBD area.",

Note: you will need an Opal Card - you can get them free card from most convenience stores or the ticket vending machine at the station. You just need to top these cards up, you can use the Opal card on all public transport When getting out of Bondi it is better to get the bus from Hall Street location as the closest bus stop gets ridiculously busy at the end of a hot summers day.

With so many different people there has been some interesting moments, lots of wine, some cheese and way too much Chilean pisco. \r\n\r\nAirbnb has been a great experience, it has been wonderful sharing my home with so many different people. \r\n\r\nYou want to know a bit about me? I am a fun, friendly, easy-going, local girl that would love to share some of the relaxed Bondi life with some new mates (like you). In the summer, I can be found on the beach or doing yoga, occasionally I even break out the old sneakers and do the cliff run. My favorite thing is a cheeky glass of wine on a Sunday afternoon watching the sun set over Bondi -  especially when there is a bit of cheese and some good company to go with it! \r\n\r\nI've lived in Bondi for nearly 5 years now (it\u2019s gone by FAST).  People often ask me what it\u2019s like to live in such a beautiful spot. It\u2019s simple really \u2013 it\u2019s bloody awesome! There is nothing like going for a swim in the ocean before work\u2026that is if I can get myself to leave the sun soaked coziness of my living room.\r\n\r\nI have done lots of travel myself and understand the need to find that great little spot that only the locals know about. This is the biggest reason I love Airbnb, it makes travel so much more personal and allows everyone to get the \u2018local experience\u2019.  I\u2019m really pleased at the prospect of playing a part in someone\u2019s dream holiday!\r\n\r\nCome on over and give me the chance to enhance your Bondi experience! I\u2019m pretty enthusiastic about our little part of the world so always happy to give advice or point you in the right direction!",

You can walk pretty much everywhere from the apartment including: Harbour Bridge, Opera House, Sydney Harbour, Botanical Gardens, Sydney CBD and shopping arcades, Funky suburbs such as Surrey Hills/ Potts Point/ Paddington, Contemporary Arts Museum, National Gallery, NSW State Museum, China Town, Darling Harbour, Rushcutters Bay...... all within a 20min walk. Darlinghurst and Surry Hills is famous for great cafes, small bars, amazing restaurants, live music and Oxford St - home of many gay friendly venues. Our area is also one of the oldest suburbs in Sydney and one with a colourful history - home to Sydney's underworld throughout the early 1900's. You can download a free tour app to learn about riots, criminals and mob bosses that ruled the area for more than 40 years. The CBD also offers lots to see and do - Hyde Park contains the war monument and is bord",
    "notes": "The apartment is accessible by en elevator so no stairs. There is 2hr street parking in the area, but it is difficult to leave a car for long periods. Check in time is normally 3pm and check out time is 10am. I often have back to back bookings and I outsource the cleaning so its important to allow the cleaners enough time to turnover the property. Many thanks",
    "transit": "Walking is the easiest and quickest way to get into the city, and you can travel on foot to most of Sydney's great attractions from the apartment. However if you want to go further it's a 2 minute walk to Museum Station on the City Circle train route which connects most of the suburban lines.  There is also a bus stop right outside with goes to Bondi Beach. Its also a short train ride to Circular Quay where you can any of the ferries on Sydney Harbour. To/From the airport. Taxi should cost between 35 and 40 and take around 25 mins depending on traffic. Alternatively you can catch the train which is about 15 one way - it takes you right into the city. Get off at Museum Station and walk 2 minutes up Liverpool St - super easy!",

There\u2019s really nowhere in the world quite like Darling Harbour. From first light to starry nights, there\u2019s always something going on here. Coffee machines froth, water laps, children play, friends chat, steaks sear, glasses clink, bass thumps and fireworks crackle. Infectious sounds travel on harbour breezes as text messages and online updates share snapshots of good times. There are tons of things to do in the city itself which are mostly a quick stroll away. I've included most of my favorite places and more in my extensive \"Local Recommendations Guidebook\" on this listings page, so please feel free to check em' out for awesome things to do and eat in the CBD area.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Impressive and extremely convenient surroundings. We're situated on Kent St in Sydney's CBD, just a stone's throw away from Darling Harbour and Wynyard Station. There\u2019s really nowhere in the world quite like Darling Harbour. From first light to starry nights, there\u2019s always something going on here. Coffee machines froth, water laps, children play, friends chat, steaks sear, glasses clink, bass thumps and fireworks crackle. Infectious sounds travel on harbour breezes as text messages and online updates share snapshots of good times. There are tons of things to do in the city itself which are mostly a quick stroll away. I've included most of my favorite places and more in my extensive \"Local Recommendations Guidebook\" on this listings page, so please feel free to check em' out for awesome things to do and eat in the CBD area.",

It can also be reached by a short bus ride and a 5-10 minutes walk.) There are cafes, restaurants, shopping and a great pub just around the corner so you probably won't even use the well equipped kitchen.  Or you can head over to many of the numerous parks that line the harbour and have a picnic. The apartment has a double brass bed in the bedroom and a double sofa bed in the living room  . All linen and towels are provided. There is also parking available. You may want to spend a moment sitting on the balcony admiring  the Harbour Bridge views but my guess is you will want to jump straight onto one of the passing ferries and explore Sydne",

It has lovely high ceilings and a sense of bygone days despite the modern kitchen and more contemporary furnishings. There is a coin operated laundry with a washer and dryer at the back of the building which we share with the others. We also have a garage which may be available during your stay with us. This is not a high tech ultra-modern pad. It is quaint and quiet and will suit those of you looking for an opportunity to experience the culture of East Balmain. Our apartment is unique and in a very special building and as such we cannot permit any smoking either inside or outside on our balcony.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Due to all the surrounding neighbourhood businesses and the adjacent shopping centre, Marion Street is well serviced and always full of life and activity.  It is a real and authentic suburb of Sydney that is not a tourist make-over. Norton Street is also a short 10 minute walk away. It is the main shopping strip of Leichhardt, with a cool cinema and other large shopping centres, as well as many quirky shops and good restaurants. In Leichhardt there are many parks, sports areas, an excellent aquatic centre and more. Iron Cove Bay is just down the hill and that has a great 8 km. walk-run-cycle circuit commonly called the Bay Run.",
    "notes": "GENERALLY  A mix of Ghetto and Little Italy......our home is simple, grungy, crude, casual, artistic, unusual.....definitely far from perfect.  It has a crazy hip-hop style mixed with old-school rustic ambiance.....the place has mood and attitude ;-) It's a work in progress with parts incomplete, raw, rudimentary and skeletal. Nevertheless, in our opinion it feels organic, natural and relaxed. It's a no fuss place. Nothing too delicate and fine. It's easy to just 'hang-out and chill' here.  It has real people and a sense of history too. Travellers come and go, yet here too is a journey..... Despite the 'chic & shock' of our urban graffiti decor, it's still our home and we welcome you to make it yours too. THE ENTRANCE It's an unusual looking entrance; somewhat  'dark n weird' , so try not to run away. Take courage and it will get better as you rise....;-) I personally prefer a dark candle-lit gothic ambiance. I find it easy, soft and subtle on the eye. It also adds a lot of depth and i",
    "transit": "GENERALLY: Marion St is very accessible and transport is readily available. BUSES: Bus-Stops are 30 meters away or 1 minute walk. LIGHT RAIL (Tram): The station is a 5 minutes walk away. TRAINS: Petersham Metro Train Station is just 10 minutes away by bus. There are 2 train stations within 1.8 km.  CAR: parking is usually available on adjacent streets. They are unmetered. BIKE: A house bike is available for guests. Here is some general travel information for you :)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CONVENIENT TRAVEL  TO & FROM THE AIRPAD ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Please check Reviews.  There are some general comments on the issue, such as  'conveniently located' & 'getting around is easy'. Opal Transport Cards allows cheap and integrated use of buses, trains, light rail (trams) and ferries. For your general info, the bus stop is 20metres or 1 minute away on Marion Street.  \"Too easy\".,,,;-) The AirPad is located on a main bus route to the city; travelling along Parramatta Road, b",
    "access": "CHECK-IN TIME Guests can access the AirPad upon specified check-in time is usually 3pm. However, upon request I may be flexible with early or very late check-in times. I usually; but not always, block-out the day before each reservation in order to allow guests the possibility of an early check-in.  I try to assist all my guests; but especially international travellers, who arrive at airports at unpredictable hours. I don't like my guests to be troubled by long waits for check-in; especially with lots of luggage to cart around. INSTANT BOOKING: Should this setting be 'on' at the time:- PLEASE MAKE SURE  YOU ARRANGE FOR  ANY ALTERNATIVE CHECK-IN TIME WITH ME 'BEFORE' YOU INSTANT BOOK. ARRIVAL NOTICE: Please notify your Expected Arrival Time in advance of your Arrival Date. Prior to Check-in, please also contact me at least 1 hour prior to your Actual Arrival Time in order to assure access into the apartment and also a proper reception. This also help me in case you are experiencing flig",
    "interaction": "We aim to keep things natural and easy. We are happy to appropriately interact or allow plenty of independence. We are also pleased to assist with any problems that you may have and provide guidance, information or directions.",
    "house_rules": "GENERAL:- I do not usually judge, choose or select. Guests are chosen on a first come, first serve basis. This has not been a problem for me because 98% of guest are 'normal'; no matter what origins or background. My guests are usually fantastic people and I do not need to 'curb or cull' behaviour with my preconceived ideas of courtesy, respect and good manners.  Therefore the following information is written for the 2% of irregular and 'unruly' types, that need basic house rules to be 'spelt out'; albeit with all due respect. Please don't assume that 'easy access' into my home means that 'I don't care', or I don't have expectation, or this is a license to stretch the limits of courtesy and respect, or that I will not act to correct misbehaviour. Take special note that this is a communal 'guest home' and not a private commercial 'boarding house'. The care-factor is certainly far greater that the basic financial dealing at hand. I can easily let go of the business because the Airbnb inc",

It\u2019s now been some time since I have made a journey overseas. Hopefully this will happen in the near future. But in the meantime, I look forward to meeting wonderful travelers adventuring here in Australia via Airbnb. This global community makes me feel that I too belong to a world of friendly and likeminded people seeking wonderful and unique experiences. No matter where people come from, it\u2019s amazing to see how much we have in common. I just love the way that unknown people and places can become familiar and meaningful.\r\nI have lived in Leichhardt for the last 20 years. Our shop-top apartment is our home. I do love it here in Sydney and feel that this is my place, home, culture. I am happy to host with conviction because it comes naturally. \r\nI am also a busy working person and am usually out and about. When I am at home, I am easy going and approach things in an easy and non-intrusive way. However, I can also be communicative and engaging. I am generous in nature and happy to share. I will most certainly aim to facilitate and make your stay as pleasant as I can. I am very willing to point you in the right direction.\r\nMy interests are design, arts and especially architecture. I am also keen on building construction projects, environmental issues and community matters.",

I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve been a Sydney local for over 60 years, and I couldn\u2019t imagine living anywhere else.\r\n\r\nI love it here because there\u2019s something magical in the Sydney Air. It\u2019s the perfect combination of a living amidst a beautiful harbor city, with laid-back people and a never-ending list of fun and exciting things going on all months of the year.\r\n\r\nNow that I\u2019m retired, I like to fill up my days with the things I enjoy the most \u2013 going for walks (I live in a great city to do this!), playing bridge and trying to improve my photography skills (again\u2026 a great city for this too!)\r\n\u00a0\r\nI enjoy travelling the world and experiencing different cultures . My favourite countries are Italy, France and Argentina. Through these travels, I\u2019ve been fortunate to learn what a good Airbnb experience (and host) looks like: A great home, with a friendly host, in a great neighbourhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.\r\n\r\nLike most Aussies, I like to keep a laid-back attitude to life. As they say - don\u2019t worry about the world ending today\u2026 it\u2019s already tomorrow in Australia.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Haymarket is a locality of Sydney's city centre, New South Wales, Australia. It is located at the southern end of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Sydney. Haymarket includes much of Sydney's Chinatown, Thaitown and Railway Square localities. Haymarket is adjacent to Darling Harbour and is surrounded by the suburbs of Ultimo, Chippendale, Surry Hills and the Sydney CBD. The location of the unit is absolutely fantastic right across the road from the World Square shopping and just 2 streets from ChinaTown.  You'll have heaps of food options to choose from. It depends on your tastes but I can recommend my personal favourites : Chat Thai 20 Campbell St. Haymarket - best Thai food Haymarket Hotel - Cheapest but excellent australian steak and chips deal for only 12 Din Tai Fung World Square - fantastic dumplings. Also try Uncle Mings on York Street. Macchiato Wood Fire Pizza corner liverpool and Pitt Street for Italian food. Also try  Vapiano o",

My goal in life is to one day visit every country in the world, I hold no bias to any of them and hope that I get the opportunity. So far I have visited 42 countries. Last year I spent 1 year travelling in South and Central America and loved the opportunity I had to learn Spanish. It was a great experience and one that I will never forget. \r\n\r\nMy hobbies include all forms of board sports, skating, surfing and snowboarding primarily. I enjoy learning about new cultures especially their foods. I grew up in an Italian restaurant so my love for food and cooking is deeply engrained in my personality. \r\n\r\nMy style of hosting and living life in general is pretty relaxed. I will do my best to greet you at the door and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. But if you just want to chill I can totally relate. \r\n\r\nI also love music and watching live music. I mostly go out to see House, deep house and techno music as that scene in Sydney is easily accessible. However at home you will find me listening to hip-hop, reggae, latin, afro-beat, jazz and anything with a smooth and funky beat. \r\n\r\nIf you need recommendations about food or music in Sydney these are probably my two strongest topics, so please don't hesitate. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to meeting more crazy, fun and cool people through Airbnb. \r\n\r\nJoel",

The Star Casino is a few minutes walk away, as well as many of Sydney's main attractions including the Aquarium, Madam Tussauds, the Powerhouse Museum and the Maritime Museum. Chinatown is only a short walk or a short trip on the light rail tram, and the Ian Thorpe Aquatic and Fitness Centre is on the next corner.",

Home to some of the trendiest cafes, restaurants and boutiques, you\u2019ll feel as though you've stumbled upon a little patch of Paris (yes, some clich\u00e9s exist for a reason: the \"Potts Point is like Paris\" line is one such clich\u00e9... ) Tree-lined streets, gorgeous old art deco buildings, stunning views and the eclectic mix of amazing locals. Potts Point is close to everything, walking distance to the city and all landmarks. On one hand you have the Botanic gardens, Opera house and ABC pool, on the other hand cafes, train station, restaurants and shopping. Three big parks around the corner just waiting for you to grab a blanket and hang out people watching. Potts Point is as great and appreciated amongst families as a group of girlfriends looking for a good time or couples wanting amazing food to explore hand in hand.",

This will in total take you about 20 min. By cab  from the airport in-between 15-35 min depending on traffic. The city center and all the famous landmarks are in walking distance. If you prefer to take the train that will take you 5 min from Kings Cross. Overall the communications from this area are the best in Sydney.",

But don\u2019t worry I also love to bake Swedish delicacies such as Cinnamon rolls and \u201dSemla\u201d and I make a mean Espresso Martini. Passionately love Sydney and try to visit a new restaurant, cafe, place every week to stay up to date. Happy to give you all our recommendation on everything from best bar, perfect pre-work run, must do\u00b4s etc. Beside from Sydney other favorite destinations are: Copenhagen, Palm Springs, anywhere in the Greek islands, Hawaii or why not a snowy ski slope finished with hot coca!

    "notes": "If you need any special requirements or request anything that you need help with please don't hesitate to ask. Even though check in is 12pm and check out is 10am I'm happy to be somewhat flexible depending if I have any guests arriving the day that you check out.",

There is one conveniently located on Darlinghurst Road on the way to the train station and bus stop on Bayswater Road. You can download the Tripview app to organise your trips and travel time. Although if the weather is right then walking  is the perfect way to see Sydney. Sydney City Shuttle  (phone number hidden)  Does drop offs between Sydney Airport and The Kirketon Hotel (only 2 doors away).  So make sure you mention the name of this hotel when you are booking. Taxis are easy to catch from the front of the building. UBER is super popular in Sydney, so download the app for discounted private taxi rates. Download the Trip View app to get all the latest updates and information on buses, trains and ferries.",

It depends on your tastes but I can recommend my personal favourites : Chat Thai 20 Campbell St. Haymarket - best Thai food Haymarket Hotel - Cheapest but excellent australian steak and chips deal for only 12 Din Tai Fung World Square - fantastic dumplings. Also try Uncle Mings on York Street. Macchiato Wood Fire Pizza corner liverpool and Pitt Street for Italian food. Also try  Vapiano on York Street. It is just a street away from Hyde Park where you can catch many buses to the Eastern suburbs including Bondi Beach and Coo",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Bondi Junction is the perfect balance between the city and the sea. We have one of the largest Westfield Shopping centres in Sydney, home to major international brands and fantastic eateries. There is also a major cinema and multiple grocery stores for all your needs. Just down the road from Bondi Junction towards the city is the very fashionable Woollahra and Paddington neighbourhoods. These are full to the brim with high end boutiques, delightful cafes, bookstores and an arthouse theatre. Down the hill the other way is Bondi and the iconic Bondi Beach, with restaurants, cafes, markets, and plenty of nightlife. Centennial park is a short walk away, with bicycle riding paths, playing fields, walking tracks and wonderful picnic areas, a perfect way to spend a sunny afternoon. Our favorite places to eat include the Nelson Bay Tuck Shop (fresh healthy breakfasts / brunch), El Topo (mexican on top of Eastern Hotel), guzman and gomez (mexican takeaway chain), Arthurs Pizza and Bondi Pizza,",
    "notes": null,
    "transit": "Bondi Junction is a major transport hub. Bondi Junction train station is at the end of the T4 Eastern suburbs line. This takes you directly into the CBD to Town Hall and Central Stations, where you can access the entire Sydney train, bus and ferry network. On top of the train station is the Bondi Junction bus interchange. From here you can catch buses direct to Bondi beach, as well as other famous beaches around the eastern suburbs such as Bronte, Coogee and Maroubra.  Buses will also take you towards the city, stopping near the boutiques and cafes along Oxford Street in Paddington & Woollahra, and onto to Hyde Park and the CBD. We are also located a 20min walk from the iconic Sydney Cricket Ground and Sydney Football stadium, should your stay involve any sporting or concert events there.",
    "access": "Guests will have access to the entire apartment. There is a balcony accessible from the loungroom with great views towards Sydney harbour and back towards Bondi. There is a gym in the building for residents only, that guests can access. As well as a heated lap pool and spa next to the gym. Visitor parking is also available for guests.",
    "interaction": "At this stage I am opening the apartment while I'm away, so there will be little interaction sadly. On most occasions my adult children will facilitate your arrival and departure. On rare occasions they may need to access some stored items in the spare bedroom during your stay, however this will be confirmed and negotiated with you before arrival.",
    "house_rules": "We only ask that you treat this place as if it were your own home. We want you to be comfortable and feel free to make use of all the facilities available, but just ask that you leave the place clean and tidy upon your departure. No smoking at all inside the apartment please. Preferred non-smokers, but if the urge strikes, then please take yourself onto the balcony and close the sliding door. Thank you. Check out is 10am but we are happy to facilitate a late check out if there are no other guests booked, just give us a shout. Please also contact us to arrange your check in time.",

It's about as small as 2 bedroom flats come, but we've been very happy here for more than 10yrs.  It's well located between the city and eastern beaches with 24hr bus transport.  A magnificent huge park is a few minutes walk away.   We usually lend the flat to friends when we go away but when there are no takers, Airbnb can help fund our holiday accommodation.",
    "space": "The thing to note is that the flat is small and not really suitable for more than 2 adults, 3 tops.    You could wedge in up to 3 kids in the little room, on the sofa bed and on a mattress on the floor...but it sure would be cramped.  It would be perfect for a couple who would use the little room as a dressing/luggage room.  It's our home, and we'll try to leave surfaces clutter free, but the wardrobe and cupboard space is very limited.   There's a separate laundry but there's no clothes dryer.  This is because there are good outdoor and undercover shared washing lines downstairs.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Centennial Park the suburb consists of just a few streets, named after the actual park.  A real gift.  Explore it on the net before you come.  An enormous space so close to the city.  It has cycling and running tracks, ponds with ducks and black swans, a cafe, an outdoor cinema in summer....oh and the trees - paperbarks, eucalyptus, figs and ferns.   To have this on our doorstep AND so many urban offerings is really unique.   Adjacent suburbs within walking distance are Paddington (Saturday markets, cafes, trendy clothes, a dozen pubs and the Oxford St vibe), Woollahra, Randwick (Racecourse and University of NSW beyond), Moore Park (The Sydney Cricket Ground and Football Stadium, Fox Studios and the Entertainment Quarter - loads of cinemas and bars)  and Bondi Junction (mega-mall and train station).",
    "notes": "Here are some reasons why this might not suit you (yes really!); You're very tall and you've always had queen or king beds.  A double bed could be a problem. Heather's an informal kind of person who doesn't iron the pillowcases or fold the end of the toilet paper.   The place is smoke and pet free There's no gym or pool or other mod cons.  The kitchen is not stainless steel or caesar stone and does not have Smeg appliances, a dishwasher or a clothes dryer. The shower is over the bath and your knees don't bend like they used to...so getting in and out of the shower might be difficult. You'd prefer a gas rather than an electric cooktop. You'd rather have something with more personality - high ceilings and french doors...This is in a tower block built in about 1980.",
    "transit": "Getting around is really easy once you've got your Opal card and done a little homework on the buses.  They go every few minutes along Oxford St, 7 mins away. The flat is between the city and eastern beaches of Bondi, Bronte, Coogee etc.  Our street sits between two main transport corridors - Oxford St and Anzac Parade with frequent 24hr buses in both directions.  Try the Trip Planner at the Transport NSW site.  It will suggest ways, and how long it takes, and how much it costs, to get to your place of work/family/interest.  Highly recommended before you make a decision.  From the city, catch a 333, 380, (from Circular Quay to Bondi Beach via Bondi Junction) M40 (from Chatswood and North Sydney to Bondi Junction) or 440 (from Central Station to Bronte via Bondi Junction) to the corner of Oxford St and Jersey Rd, Woollahra/Paddington - it's a 7 min walk from there.  These buses are very frequent - all but the M40 run until midnight.  The 380 is 24hrs.  Less frequent daytime buses also r",

I like uncluttered, light spaces and prefer simplicity and informality over anything fancy or fussy.  The Annexe is all these things so please consider...\r\n\r\nI've worked as a teacher or sailor in The UK, Spain, Taiwan, Ecuador and Antigua and travelled a great deal in between.  Now working and settled in Sydney with my non travelling partner.  We've been offering short term leases on The Annexe (our investment property) for 6yrs through other sources.  We live in the same street so feel it brings the world to us, with its revolving door of custodians.  \r\n\r\nI used Airbnb for the first time as a guest in Melbourne for my Scottish cousin and I in January 2013.  We loved our groovy warehouse there.  Then in July 2014 my mother and I hit the jackpot again with a lovely sunny winter home away from home in Byron Bay.  So I'm a repeat offender, enjoying the Airbnb community as both a host and a guest.",

Coffee machines froth, water laps, children play, friends chat, steaks sear, glasses clink, bass thumps and fireworks crackle. Infectious sounds travel on harbour breezes as text messages and online updates share snapshots of good times. There are tons of things to do in the city itself which are mostly a quick stroll away. I've included most of my favorite places and more in my extensive \"Local Recommendations Guidebook\" on this listings page, so please feel free to check em' out for awesome things to do and eat in the CBD area.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "The Opera house is only a short stroll away (approx 2km), a wonderful walk or run through Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens. Have brunch in the hipster Darlinghurst and Surry Hills (the home of fine dining, quirky lunches and lane way bars), head to The Rocks by the harbour Bridge for a drink in one of the oldest pubs in Sydney, and nurse the hangover the next day shopping on the infamous George St and lunching at Darling Harbour.",
    "notes": "We are a couple that loves to travel, so make an offer for any weekend and if we can we will use the opportunity to vacate the property for you and get away for the weekend! Friday and Saturday nights, 2 night stay required. It is likely we will not be there, but have friends that 'concierge' for us if we are not able to meet.",
    "transit": "Airport line goes right through to Museum station, which is a very short 250m away. Also only 700m from central station.  Bus stops by Hyde Park can get you to eastern suburbs like Bondi on 25min,the train is even quicker from town hall (but gets you to Bondi junction, not all the way to the beach!)",

WiFi included, will provide the password on arrival.  Use the laundry ~ washer and dryer. All powders provided, as well as iron and ironing board of course. Dishwasher built in, you shouldn't need to wash up on holiday! Plenty of cups plates and cutlery etc.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Rich with history, culture and sophistication, Potts Point is an ideal place to stay or visit for those who want to enjoy the picturesque surroundings of a bygone era and still be close to everything Sydney has to offer. Potts Point situated within Sydney City is just a short 20-minute walk to the CBD and a stone's throw from Kings Cross Railway Station, so you can easily catch a train to some of Sydney's major attractions. Sydney Buses, Taxis and Car Hire are also readily available in the immediate vicinity. As for dining out, Victoria St, and in particular Macleay St, are dotted with a range of restaurants to suit all tastes. Kings Cross, Darlinghurst Rd offers a countless number of nightclubs, bars and theatres for those who enjoy the nightlife. Or for the more subdued there are plenty of parks, museums and harbour side charm in the neighbouring suburbs.",
    "notes": "Most things you need are in the places you expect to find them.",
    "transit": "Plenty of public transport is just outside the door, but walking to the city is even easier than the one or two stops on the train.",

Either way, we'll do our best to sort things out. - Absolutely no smoking, including hanging outside the window! This is important and ignoring this rule will affect your security deposit. - We really appreciate it if you can leave the place reasonably clean on your departure. My cleaner does a great job, but it's much nicer for if you guys leave your dishes done etc. so she can just focus on cleaning and restocking things like tea and coffee for the next guest :) - As already stated in the notes and house rules, if you require extra bedding for the sofa bed and you are not paying for a third guest, there is a one-time 25 surcharge for the additional laundry charges we incur. One-time and not per night. Cot use is also a one-time fee of 25. We ask guests to leave 25 on the table for our cleaners who manages the laundry se",

I work at the building as the building maintenance manager & I'm around at least half of the time to easily assist you in any way I can. I'm also easily contactable at all other times and I'll ensure I make your stay awesome & memorable.\r\nAs a host, I'm always trying to improve and better myself. Every interaction with every guest adds to my experiences as a host & improves my ability to understand and service all of your needs. I love sharing information, life experiences, skills & knowledge and in turn I love to learn from others, hearing new ideas and trying new things. I'm a genuine person, I'm accepting of everyone's unique qualities and differences without any pre-judgement or criticism no matter what it is. I love meeting new people & spending time with family & friends. I enjoy all sports, running on the beach, Surfing, listing to music, going to concerts and movies, travelling and everything else life has to offer. \r\nI once played competitive sports and with a love for the outdoors I chose to study construction rather than a career that would confine me to an office chair. I also hold an associate diploma in applied science and have traveled extensively throughout Europe, North America & parts of South East Asia. Unfortunately, time & money constraints have prevented more recent travel, although I look forward to travelling more in the near future.",

All linen, towels, - everything you would expect in a hotel but much, much more space at a quarter of the price.\r\n\r\nYou are very welcome to use the entire apartment, the kitchen, laundry, lounge... everywhere!\r\n\r\nWe work during the day and sometimes go out at night but I am sure our paths will cross. We are quiet and very respectful of your space.\r\n\r\nThe location is perfect for the travelers or business men wanting quick and easy access to everything. \r\n\r\nWe are a very short walk to supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and a similarly short walk to all that Surry Hills (famous for its shopping, restaurants, bars and pubs), CBD, Circular Quay (Sydney Opera) and then Darling Harbour have to offer.\r\n\r\nBuses to the beach are a block away, light rail is at 2 minute which will take you out of the city. You have several parks around. Its a beautiful neighborhood.",

Coffee machines froth, water laps, children play, friends chat, steaks sear, glasses clink, bass thumps and fireworks crackle. Infectious sounds travel on harbour breezes as text messages and online updates share snapshots of good times. There are tons of things to do in the city itself which are mostly a quick stroll away.

The room I'm renting is my very own, as I'm go away during the weekends. The bed is very comfy and you will have plenty of space to put your clothes.
